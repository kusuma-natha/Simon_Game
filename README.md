2. Watch as the colors flash in a specific sequence.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the colored buttons.

## Code Overview

### JavaScript (`app.js`)

- **Game Logic**:
  - `gameSeq` and `userSeq` arrays store the game’s color sequence and the player’s sequence.
  - `levelUp()` function generates a new random color each level, updating the `gameSeq` and displaying the level.
  - `checkAns()` function verifies if the player’s sequence matches the game’s; if incorrect, a "Game Over" message is displayed.
- **Event Handling**:
  - `keypress` event listener starts the game.
  - Each button has a `click` event listener to handle the player’s input.

### HTML (`index.html`)

Basic structure includes:
- Title and heading to display game status.
- A container with four colored buttons (pink, orange, green, purple) for interaction.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simon-says-game.git

2. Open index.html in your web browser to play the game.
